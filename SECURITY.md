## About my repositories

Each of my repositories has 2 branches:

* `dev`: A development branch for experimental features and ongoing work. This branch may contain incomplete or untested code.
* `main`: The production-ready branch, reflecting the most recent stable version of the project. Content on green-glitch.github.io is directly deployed from this branch.

To integrate new features, I merge the `dev` branch into the `main` branch via a `git merge` operation.
